# **Hybrid-Cryptosystems**

## **Background**
The world of cryptography runs insanely deep, so I'll be providing a short but limited background here. Most security related jobs don't require extremely specific knowledge of cryptography, but understanding it's context and necessity is imperative.
- **Cryptography** is often defined as the study of techniques for secure communication, which involves creating codes that allow info to remain secret. It's goal is to ensure Privacy, Authentication, Integrity, and Non-repudiation (P.A.I.N. framework).
- **Encryption** is the process of encoding a message or other information is such a way that only authorized parties can see it. In a more technical sense, it involves converting plaintext into ciphertext with the use of an encryption algorithm and some sort of key.
- **Symmetric key algorithms** use the same key to encrypt and decrypt info, and are less computationally intense. They use Advanced Encrytion Standard, or AES.
- **Asymmetric key algorithms** use two keys, a public and private key. They are more computationally intense, but easier to use with many people, and involve the verification of one's identity via digital signatures. They use Rivest-Shamir-Adleman standard, or RSA.
- **Hybrid cryptosystems**, which we'll be using today, combine the convenience of a asymmetric systems with the efficiency of symmetric systems. 

## **Objective**
- Use a hybrid cryptosystem to exchange encrypted messages with another party

## **Setup**
- This has a wide range of applications, but we'll go ahead and do this in any Linux distribution. 
- It's recommended to have a partner for this project, but if you don't have one, you can easily complete it on your own by sending files and messages between two VMs. If you choose to do this, it's recommended to use a service such as Slack (you can just boot it up on the web browser) to transfer files painlessly. I used the **Ubuntu** and **Kali** distributions just fine to run this.

## **Process** 
- The general outline is as follows: 
1. we'll be using OpenSSL
